- ✅ **Automatic Verification** - Runs before form submission
- ✅ **User-Friendly Messages** - Clear feedback during verification

## ✅ **Setup Complete!**

### **Keys Updated:**

### **3. Server-Side Verification (Optional):**
For maximum security, verify the reCAPTCHA token on your server:
- Send the token to your backend
- Verify with Google's API using your secret key
- Only process forms with valid tokens

## 🎯 **How It Works:**

1. **User fills form** → Validation runs
2. **reCAPTCHA verification** → Invisible check runs
3. **If valid** → Form submits to EmailJS + Cratio CRM
4. **If invalid** → User sees "Security verification failed" message
